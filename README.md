# e-Shopping
This is an online shopping website which consists of items for sale and the quantity field.

I have developed a web application for an Online Store. I have done server-side programming only using Express web application framework and store data into MongoDB.

HTML Static Content- Web Form is used in the front end to collect all the information needed to mail out the purchased items to the customer.

Server-side programming using JavaScript, EJS, Express and Node.js

Generate a receipt to give to the customer, including all the information entered by the user and the products bought only using server-side scripting for this.

Save data to MongoDB

Saved all the data from the web form along with any calculated values to a MongoDB database

Retrieve data from MongoDB

Created a new page that fetches and shows the orders from the MongoDB database in a tabular format.

To execute the code:

Open the code in Visual Studio Code

Install node modules using 'npm install'

Install MongoDB Compass to save the data to Mongo DB and retrieve the data from Mongo DB
